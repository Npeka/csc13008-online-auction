This mature pair is ready to breed and has been raised fully aquatic, feeding well on live blackworms and frozen bloodworms. We’ve been keeping and breeding Kaiser Newts from our original group since 2011, with excellent long-term success and healthy bloodlines. They thrive in hard, well-filtered water with a pH around 8.0, and we use limestone in the aquarium to help maintain water hardness and stability. Best kept between 60–70°F, with breeding often triggered in the low 60s. These newts are extremely rare, and preserving their captive population is a top priority, so they’re best suited for responsible, experienced amphibian keepers. Please note that Kaiser Newts are expert escape artists and must be housed in a secure aquarium with no gaps or openings. Serious inquiries only—help continue the conservation of this stunning and critically endangered species.\n\nPairs are $600 shipped\nAdditional females are available for $250",

If you inquiry to buy I will ask for pictures of current setups and experience and a picture of your commercial fridge, large wine cooler, etc. I only accept payment through Zelle or PayPal F&F.",

We thought she was a male when we got her and by the time we figured it out, the name stuck.\n\nShe was born Sept 7, 2018 and we bought her from GradeAReptiles, arriving here Nov 20, 2018. She has always been darkly colored. She didn’t breed until 5 years old. In 2024, she had 11 babies; in 2025, she had 29. A few of her babies seem to be darkly colored. \n\nWilliam is very used to handling. She is extremely docile, does not bite, or even musk. She eats 1 or 2 large hairless frozen / thawed mice twice a week. Note that she is now and always has been, a very slow eater. She likes to hover over her food for a while and sometimes even rest her chin on it before eating. If she’s in a group enclosure, you need to protect her food from would-be thieves.\n\nInquire for more pics and vids.\n\nWe ship to all states *except* California.

    "description": "Phelsuma klemmeri unsexed juveniles. Happy and healthy, these guys are growing fast! If you are looking to set up your own breeding group, we recommend you start here. Group discounts available upon request starting at groups of 4+ individuals.\n\nJuveniles ship starting at 1.5 - 3 months of age on average depending on size, at which point they are well started. If you purchase multiple klemmeri, we will provide unrelated genetics where possible and do our best to ensure a diverse pool of genetics for your group. Our breeding Phelsuma klemmeri adults were originally sourced from as many different breeders as we could find, with multiple unrelated lines from each source whenever possible. We also occasionally bring in new genetics. As a result, we now have many unrelated genetic lines available.\n\n \n\nPhelsuma klemmeri, commonly known as the Neon Day Gecko, is an endangered species of small day gecko which exhibit some of the brightest colors amongst all geckos. Endemic to northwest Madagascar, klemmeri are most commonly found in bamboo forests. Maxing out at a size of roughly 3.5 inches, both mature and juvenile klemmeri display vibrant yellow-green heads and turquoise bodies accompanied by bold black stripes on their flanks. Sexual dimorphism is not seen in color or pattern for this species, so females are equally stunning as males!\n\nUnlike most Phelsuma, klemmeri are social and do well in groups. Parents do not eat their young as is common with most day geckos. Hatchlings can be raised with the parents, although they should be removed before reaching sexual maturity to avoid territorial disputes among males and to prevent inbreeding. We keep our klemmeri in 1.3 groups and raise some of the young in with the parents. Social interactions can regularly be observed amongst the group, ranging from head bobbing, tail waving, to walking up to another gecko for a greeting lick on the nose! These endearing social interactions combined with the natural curiosity and observant nature of klemmeri makes them endlessly captivating in the terrarium.\n\nWe have found Phelsuma klemmeri to be resilient and easy to breed under proper conditions. Female klemmeri in breeding groups produce a pair of eggs roughly every 3-5 weeks. They produce continuously throughout the majority of the year, with each pair slowing down only for several months out of the year.",

Shows darker more often not than pictured in these photos. \nMom was an amazing dark based female that really dominated the offspring from this pairing. Most animals ended up with dark bases with purples mostly but some with reds. The dad had a similar base color to the color in these pictures but had nice red spots. This male is proven and has bred 3 seasons for me. A very productive, calm and gentle breeder. He will be a nice addition to any breeding project with a focus on dark bases, color (offspring has had nice reds and purples) and size.",

    "description": "The Goliath Wooly Red Leg, known as Avicularia Tucurui is a locality variant of Avicularia Braunshauseni that’s native to Brazils Tucurui river! Unlike the much more common A. Braunshauseni… The Goliath Wooly Red Leg boasts vibrant reds and aquamarine blues while also having longer hairs giving them a fluffy/wooly appearance that’s unlike any other pink-toe! And with a maximum legspan of 8+ inches Avicularia Tucurui is truly one of a kind! Most Avicularia species don’t surpass 5 inches, so you can only imagine how impressive an 8 inch, docile pinktoe really is! Amazingly, this vibrant tarantula makes a wonderful pet as there easy to care for, literally never bite, and have a terrific feeding response! With that being said, Avicularia Braunshauseni, has a very calm demeanor making this species ideal for those interested in handling there pets! Additionally, this is a very rare species of pinktoe that’s commonly mislabeled and wrongly identified! More often then not, someone will purchase “Avicularia Tucuruii” raise it up only to find out they did not get a true Goliath Wooly Red Leg pinktoe… With that being said, I can guarantee what I have is the real deal as I produced this species over a year ago and analyzed the spermathecae of both my females under a microscope! Plus, the females pictured on this website are the mothers to the Juvenile females for sale! With that being said I can 100% guarantee what i have is the real deal! Having said that, these females are 3.5+ inches DLS and have been feeding on medium crickets once a week!",

Appearing like something that’s straight out of an active Volcano, the Lava Spider encompasses explosive vibrant reds that contrast magnificently with bold mat-blacks! (sometimes appearing dark blue under certain lighting)! If only my camera could capture this tarantula’s true beauty! Amazingly, this living work of art has a docile demeanor and is extremely tolerant of handling! Furthermore, they don’t burrow, making them a great display tarantula! Now being a dwarf species, that’s a bit on the larger side… you can expect your Davus sp. Panama to max out at around 4 inches in leg span. However, what they lack in size, they more then make up for with their stunning looks and aggressive feeding response! \n\nThis exact specimen is a sexually mature female that’s 3 inches in Diagonal leg span (DLS) Luckily for you this individual is WELL past the vulnerable stage for this species! You see when the Lava Spider begins life at 0.025 of an inch making them very sensitive… But at around 1 inch this species becomes extremely hardy. Tolerating both arid and humid environments! Anyways, If you’re interested in adding this EXTREMELY RARE and EXOTIC tarantula to your collection feel free to ask me any questions you may have! 😁",

I will do my best if you request a specific animal but I can’t guarantee it. If you are LOCAL you’re more than welcome to come and pick out which you’d like. \n- Checkout my Instagram if you’d like to see a video of them all! @delrayexotics",

    "description": "A truly extraordinary opportunity to acquire a  pair of Aldabra giant tortoises direct from the Aldabra Islands themselves.\n\nThis pair includes a massive 50-year-old male measuring 42 inches and weighing approximately 390 pounds, along with a beautifully proportioned 40-year-old female measuring 31 inches and weighing 210 pounds. Both are exceptional examples of their species, with unmatched size, conformation, and genetic purity.\n\nImporting adult Aldabras directly from the islands is nearly impossible today. These animals represent one of the last chances to secure original bloodlines not related to any current U.S. stock—critical for breeding programs seeking true genetic diversification. Over my 25 years as the exclusive representative for Aldabra Island exports, the majority of adult Aldabras I’ve imported have gone on to become top breeders in the United States and abroad.\n\nMature adults of this size and reproductive potential are rarely, if ever, available. Their value extends far beyond their individual rarity—they are foundational breeding animals capable of producing offspring for decades.\n\nI have been working with giant tortoises for over 40 years here on my farm in South Florida, providing lifelong support, husbandry guidance, and international export assistance. These two tortoises are of international zoo quality and represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a piece of living history and establish the cornerstone of your Aldabra breeding program.\n\nSerious inquiries only. This pair will not be available long—acquiring genuine Aldabra Island adults of this caliber is a privilege few will ever experience.",

I like to feed 70% grasses, weeds, flowers, or leaves and 30% fruits, vegetables, or a tortoise diet. For baby tortoises I prefer to not feed fruit too often, but they enjoy a little treat twice a week. The baby redfoot tortoises for sale now are mainly feeding on hibiscus leaves/flowers, collard greens, opuntia cactus, mulberry leaves, and Mazuri tortoise diet. I keep my baby tortoises in a few different types of enclosures, but I always like to use something at least 2 feet by 3 feet. An enclosure that can hold the right temperatures and humidity is very important to ensure proper health for your baby tortoises.  You can learn more on my Tortoise Care Playlist on my website and YouTube channel Shadow’s Reptiles.",

    "description": "This listing is for the buyer’s pick of one of my pictured (I am happy to send additional photos for serious inquiries) holdback 2025 Burmese stars. All were born in April, were incubated for female, and are absolutely thriving. They are also the offspring of the best tortoise I’ve ever worked with - she’s absolutely incredible. If you have the space for a medium to large(ish) sized tortoise, I don't think there's a better candidate for a pet than a Burmese star. With proper socialization, Burmese stars are \"shell dogs\". My adults rapidly approach me whenever they see me, love head and shell scratches/rubs, and will follow me around the yard when I let them. \n\nBurmese star tortoises are why I'm here; they were the first species I ever had, and I fell in love with them to the point where I've built my reptile endeavors around them. \n\nAnyone who does not live in a relatively warm climate should know that Burmese star tortoise females can reach 12+ inches and weigh 15+ pounds. Successfully keeping these inside can be accomplished, but know it will take a substantial indoor enclosure with ample lighting (heat and UVB). As larger animals, they can also be quite smelly, so keep that in mind. \n\nBurmese stars do wonderfully when kept outdoors. They thrive with high humidity (unlike Indian and Sri Lankan stars) and are rock solid animals. \n\nYou will be able to text or DM me at any time on my cell or IG for a lifetime of care guidance. I will never hold someone's lack of experience against them when inquiring about an animal. The right animal for you is the one you want the most. I'm also happy to answer any and all questions even if you you're interested but are not sure Burmese stars are for you. \n\nWith proper care, these animals should live at least in excess of 50 years. These are forever pets. But, I do understand life circumstances can change. I care very much about the animals not only going to, but also remaining at, good homes. If, for any reason, you can no longer care for an animal, please let me know, and I will try to help you find a new home for your shell buddy.",

    "description": "NOTE: Only available to states where this species is legal to be raised in captivity. If you live in a state where a permit is required then send a copy of your permit when you reach out to me. Thanks.\n\nParting with one well-started Ornate box turtle hatchling that hatched this season, from my group of adults here in Northern CA. Gorgeous hatchling, active, and firm shell with a great appetite. Pictured is the exact hatchling you will be receiving.\n\nDiet: Reptomin turtle sticks, Zoomed hatchling turtle pellets, red wigglers, ground turkey, dairy cow isopods, and dried black soldier fly larvae.\n\nWhat to expect: I am happy to answer any questions you have, before and after the transaction is over. The most important thing for me is that my animals get a good home so if you are new to the hobby then I am happy to help you with every aspect of their care.\n\nGuaranteed to be alive and outwardly healthy upon arrival if signed for upon delivery. Full refund, including the shipping cost, if the animal does not reach you alive, no excuses given. \n\nI will ship via FedEx for next-day arrival. At this time I am shipping only on Wednesdays, weather permitting. I will be checking the weather at my end, at the Memphis hub, and at your end to determine if it is safe to ship. Package has to be picked up at the hub if your daytime high is going to be over 85F.\n\nNote: Make sure you have read my store policy, understand it, and agree to it.\n\nPlease e-mail me at support@shelledfriends.com if you have any questions.",

Absolutely thriving. These are such active and inquisitive turtles. They don't bite, sometimes when raised in sand there so shy from hiding all the time they bite a lot when picked up. These have not been on sand and I've found it stops them from biting. You're welcome to raise them on sand if you would like to. Exact one pictured is the exact one for sale. \n\nWe only send out the best of the best! We ship using a styrofoam insulated box labeled “Live Reptile” on all sides. All animals are shipped FedEx priority overnight. If temps are forecasted to be below 35 or above 90 degrees, the package will need to held at your nearest fedex ship center for pick up. We always check the weather prior to shipping. 100% live and healthy arrival is always guaranteed! By ordering you agree to our store policy on Morph Market. Feel free to visit our Instagram and Facebook also linked on my store. We have hundreds of pictures and videos.",
